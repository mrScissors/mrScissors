        <h3>Academic Projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Performance variability in Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) problems </b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzed performance variations of integer optimization solvers caused by minor perturbations in the way a problem is input or changes in the solution environment (machine, compiler or libraries)</li>
                <li>Reduced variability in Quadratic Problems by changing the data structure used for storing quadratic functions</li>
                <li>Changing data structure for Quadratic Problems also improved the performance significantly</li>
                <li>Impleneted new presolving algorithms to further improve the performance</li>
            </ul>
            <li> <b>Multi-modal supply chain distribution problem</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Studied models for distribution of goods in supply chains with multiple modes of transport and with lot-sizing</li>
                <li>Studied solution methods and heuristics to solve these models</li>
            </ul>
            <li> <b>Decoupling Exploration and Exploitation in Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) setting</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed new algorithms based on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm (and its variants) for the setting where exploring and exploitation are decoupled in Stochastic MAB setting of Online Machine Learning</li>
                <li>Empirically verified the effectiveness of the new algorithms with standard UCB algorithms, and concluded that the new algorithms give much lower values of regret than standard UCB algorithms</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Multileaf Collimator Leaf Sequencing in IMRT Treatment Planning</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Studied paper by Taskin, et al, for reducing the beam on time and setup time in IMRT treatment</li>
                <li>Successfully implemented the recursive algorithm to check the feasibility of a given intensity multiset with respect to the target fluence map</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
